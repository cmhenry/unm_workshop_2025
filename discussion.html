# Discussion Activity  
## Applying Web Data Concepts to Your Research

.footnote[Break into pairs/groups, ~5–7 minutes per prompt.]

???
We’ll now connect conceptual ideas to your own research projects. Discuss in pairs or small groups; the goal is to surface practical applications and dilemmas.

---

# Prompt 1: Public vs. Private Data
- Imagine studying an online political community (e.g., activists, party members, diaspora groups).  
- Which platforms would you scrape or query via API?  
- Treat posts as **public speech** or **private communication**?  
- How would this affect ethical/legal choices?

???
Push students to think about expectations of privacy. Twitter may feel public, but WhatsApp or Discord are closer to private spaces. Their answers will depend on norms and project goals.

---

# Prompt 2: Representativeness & Bias
- Collecting data from Twitter/X or Reddit…  
- Who is **overrepresented** in your sample?  
- Who might be **missing**?  
- How could these biases shape findings?  
- What strategies could address them?

???
Encourage critical thinking: younger, more urban, tech-savvy populations dominate some platforms. Strategies: triangulate sources, weight data, or clearly scope limits in write-up.

---

# Prompt 3: Transparency & Replication
- You scrape a government website for legislative data.  
- What parts of the process should be shared for replication?  
- What risks prevent sharing raw data?  
- How to balance **open science** and **responsibility**?

???
Students should weigh transparency with ethical limits. Code, scraping scripts, and documentation are safer to share than identifiable raw datasets. Discuss replication packages in political science.

---

# ✅ Goal  
By the end of discussion:  
- Connect scraping & APIs to your **own projects**  
- Identify **ethical and methodological dilemmas**  
- Practice framing your choices for transparency & rigor

???
Wrap-up: the point is to bridge concepts with their research interests, ensuring takeaways feel personally relevant.
