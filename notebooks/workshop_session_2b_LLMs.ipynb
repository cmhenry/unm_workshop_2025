It currently represents 72% of the nation's dairy societies (208 out of 289). Membership has decreased due to the world depression and low dairy prices, leading smaller dairies to merge.\n",

            "*   **Butter Export and Marketing:** The Union has been successful in promoting butter exports and local consumption. Up to the end of 1934, it facilitated the sale of nearly 95 million kg of butter. In late 1934, a government-backed share company, P/S „Latvijas centralais sviesta eksports\" (United Butter Export of Latvia, Ltd.), was formed for dairy export marketing.

In 1934, it processed over 8 million kg of milk and 569,000 kg of cream, with products subject to daily quality checks. The central operates its own shops and uses a fleet of vehicles for delivery to institutions and over 1000 provision shops. Its sales have shown consistent year-on-year growth.\n",
