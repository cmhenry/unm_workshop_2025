        "\n",
        "Using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** through an **API (Application Programming Interface)** means that your computer communicates with a powerful language model over the internet using a common format and protocol—usually **HTTP requests** and **JSON data**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s what that typically involves:\n",
        "\n",
        "* 🔐 **API Key**: You first obtain an API key—a kind of password that identifies you to the LLM service (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, Google, Anthropic). This ensures secure access and tracks your usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "* 📦 **JSON**: You send your input (like a text prompt or document) in a format called **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**, which is a simple way to structure data—kind of like filling out a digital form.\n",
        "\n",
        "* 🌐 **HTTP Request**: You send this JSON to the LLM using an **HTTP request**, which is the same basic method your browser uses to visit websites—but in this case, it's your script or notebook making the request.\n",
        "\n",
        "* 🧠 **LLM Response**: The LLM processes your input and returns a **response** (also in JSON), containing the generated text, analysis, or extracted information.\n",
        "\n",
        "* 🧪 **Python & Jupyter Notebooks**: Most Digital Humanities researchers use a **scripting interface** like **Python**, often working in **Jupyter Notebooks**. These notebooks let you write and run code step by step, making it easy to send queries to the API, process responses, and analyze results alongside your research notes.\n",

        "## Securely loading API keys in your environment\n",
        "\n",
        "When working with APIs, especially those that require authentication, it's essential to handle API keys securely. Exposing your API keys can lead to unauthorized access and potential misuse of your account. Here are some best practices for securely loading API keys in your environment:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Use Environment Variables\n",
        "Store your API keys in system environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your scripts. This keeps sensitive information out of your codebase and version control.\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import os\n",
        "# Load API key from environment variable\n",
        "api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENROUTER_API_KEY\")\n",
        "if not api_key:\n",
        "    raise ValueError(\"API key not found in environment variables\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Above would require that you set up the environment variable `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in your operating system or development environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since most of us in this workshop are using Google Colab we do not have this particular system variable set up. Instead, we will use a `.env` file to store our API key and load it using the `python-dotenv` library.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Use a `.env` File\n",
        "For local development, you can use a `.env` file to store your environment variables. This file should not be committed to version control (add it to your `.gitignore` file).\n",
        "```plaintext\n",
        "# .env file\n",
        "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Use a Library to Load Environment Variables\n",
        "Use a library like `python-dotenv` to load environment variables from a `.env` file.\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
        "# Load environment variables from .env file\n",
        "load_dotenv()\n",
        "# Now you can access your API key\n",
        "api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENROUTER_API_KEY\")\n",
        "if not api_key:\n",
        "    raise ValueError(\"API key not found in environment variables\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Keep Your `.env` File Secure\n",
        "Ensure that your `.env` file is not accessible to unauthorized users. Set appropriate file permissions and avoid sharing it publicly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Rotate Your API Keys Regularly\n",
        "Regularly rotate your API keys to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. Most API providers allow you to generate new keys and revoke old ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Set limits on API Key Usage\n",
        "If your API provider allows it, set usage limits on your API keys to prevent abuse. This can include rate limiting or restricting access to specific IP addresses or applications. In our workshop each individual API KEY has a limit of 1 Euro, which is sufficient for the workshop tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. Alternative use getpass\n",
        "If you prefer not to use a `.env` file, you can use the `getpass` module to securely prompt for your API key at runtime. This way, the key is not stored in your code or a file.\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import getpass\n",
        "# Prompt for API key securely without showing it on the screen\n",
        "api_key = getpass.getpass(\"Enter your OpenRouter API key: \")\n",
        "if not api_key:\n",
        "    raise ValueError(\"API key cannot be empty\")\n",
